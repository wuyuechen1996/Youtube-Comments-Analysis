There are around 6,000,000 comments recorded in the dataset and the dataset itself is unlabeled. Each data row will have an userid, an text comment and belongs to one channel.\n\n### Dataset : \nThe dataset is acquired from GitHub. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dZk9s3qi3WwZMlgcH8GA3sP2QfJWyB8c/view?usp=sharing\n\nThere are around 6,000,000 comments recorded in the dataset and the dataset itself is unlabeled. The dataset is comma separated, with a header line defining the attribute names, listed here:\n\n  creator_name: Name of the Youtube channel creator;\n  userid: Integer identifier for the users commenting on the Youtube channels;\n  comment: Text of the comments made by the users.\n\n### Details :\n1. Searched specific terms which a cat/dog owner might have, and label those users as dog&cat owners. Also labeled users who don't have pets as those whose comments don't contain any specific terms. By this way, we turn our dataset into labeled ones and convert problem from unsupervised to supervised.\n2. Use RegexTokenizer to tokenize text comments.\n\n RegexTokenizer allows more advanced tokenization based on regular expression (regex) matching. By default, the parameter “pattern” is used as delimiters to split the input text. Alternatively, users can set parameter “gaps” to false indicating the regex “pattern” denotes “tokens” rather than splitting gaps, and find all matching occurrences as the tokenization result.)\n\n3. Use Word2Vec represent text features as vectors.\n4. Train Logistic regression model and random forest model to classify audiences. Evaluation metrics are include: precision, recall, accuracy, AUC. Based on my analysis (I only randomly pick a small portion of dataset for training in order to speed process up) random forest outperforms LR model.\n5. Use our trained model to predict all users in the dataset. And get statistical sense of how dog&cat owners' distribution. Extract word frequency to see related topics regards to those owner."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## 0.

him from petsmart and there was no hide in the cage he was in no wheel of any kind to run on... he was just exposed all day  every day and i think it traumatized him. he desperately wanted to bury himself but couldnt he was trying to dig tunnels all he was accomplishing was bulldozing the bedding around the tank and it just really upset me to see that so i took him home with me. (i also made comments about how badly he wanted to hide and couldnt to the employee though it didnt do any good) hes in a 40 gallon tank now with a ton of bedding to tunnel through and lots of places to hide. i had a feeling id never get him socialized but its ok hes still adorable to watch. and im glad hes in a place where he can tunnel down and feel safe and not exposed. hes still spoiled

but its been ramped up to like 100% it use to be really subtle now its just full force in your face. its hard not to notice and for people not to make videos of it. they do it so frequently its annoying as fuck. they want to sell it to the masses. talk about brainwashing propaganda just look up spider-man homecoming symbolism. how can people say its satire or to make fun of conspiracy theorists is beyond me. masonic symbolism has been around before it was popular even in things that didnt sell at all. look it up. or believe what the media tells you and how they portray people who

supply only would avoid any loops.   realistically this is not a real problem since any magnetic field strong enough to induce currents in a ground loop would interfere directly with the other electronics in the unshielded box.   building an analog supply would be a good idea since this unit probably radiates noise with its unshielded power supply.   anyways thanks for the

venomous snake. so i am that one friend that is a little more caution when i come across a venomous snake i dont pick them up or get to close to them like some do. the thing is i used to love catching gardener snakes all the time caught hundreds as a kid growing up snakes did not bother then. but i would hold a non venomous snake but still makes me nervous these days for some reason but i love your videos and all your animals! i have always wondered what the price difference was like you explain. now it puts into better understanding for me when your talking/holding a snake and describing it

desperately wanted to bury himself but couldnt he was trying to dig tunnels all he was accomplishing was bulldozing the bedding around the tank and it just really upset me to see that so i took him home with me. (i also made comments about how badly he wanted to hide and couldnt to the employee though it didnt do any good) hes in a 40 gallon tank now with a ton of bedding to tunnel through and lots of places to hide. i had a feeling id never get him socialized but its ok hes still adorable to watch. and im glad hes in a place where he can tunnel down and feel safe and not exposed. hes still spoiled

created a ground loop that could inductively pick up noise.  running your power cord ground to the power supply only would avoid any loops.   realistically this is not a real problem since any magnetic field strong enough to induce currents in a ground loop would interfere directly with the other electronics in the unshielded box.   building an analog supply would be a good idea since this unit probably radiates noise with its unshielded power supply.   anyways thanks for the video!</td><td>false</td><td>false</td></tr><tr><td>Bully Max</td><td>954499.0</td><td>thats why i adopted a 2

the venomous ones the most but more then that i just respect the power they have when its a venomous snake. so i am that one friend that is a little more caution when i come across a venomous snake i dont pick them up or get to close to them like some do. the thing is i used to love catching gardener snakes all the time caught hundreds as a kid growing up snakes did not bother then. but i would hold a non venomous snake but still makes me nervous these days for some reason but i love your videos and all your animals! i have always wondered what the price difference was like you explain. now it puts into better understanding for me when your talking/holding a snake and describing it now. thanks! i have always wondered this when watching your vids. very good video!
